# Telegram Bot Start Command Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Telegram bot's `/start` command is not responding after a welcome message was added via BotFather. This is a critical issue that prevents new users from accessing the Picco Mini App. The bot needs to properly handle the `/start` command regardless of BotFather welcome message configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Start Command Functionality

**User Story:** As a new user discovering the Picco bot, I want to send `/start` and immediately receive the welcome message with Mini App launch buttons, so that I can quickly access the crypto prediction platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends `/start` to the bot THEN the bot SHALL respond with the welcome message and Mini App buttons within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user sends `/start` with parameters (e.g., `/start referral_code`) THEN the bot SHALL handle the parameters AND display the welcome message
3. WHEN the `/start` command is sent multiple times THEN the bot SHALL respond consistently each time
4. WHEN BotFather welcome message is configured THEN it SHALL NOT interfere with the `/start` command handler

### Requirement 2: Message Handler Priority

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the bot, I want commands to take priority over general message handlers, so that bot commands work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends any command starting with `/` THEN the specific command handler SHALL execute before any general message handler
2. WHEN the `/start` command is processed THEN no other message handlers SHALL interfere with the response
3. WHEN multiple message handlers exist THEN commands SHALL have the highest priority

### Requirement 3: Welcome Message Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive the same welcome experience whether I use `/start` or send any other message, so that I have a consistent onboarding experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends `/start` THEN they SHALL receive the full welcome message with all Mini App buttons
2. WHEN a user sends any non-command message THEN they SHALL receive the same welcome message as `/start`
3. WHEN the welcome message is displayed THEN it SHALL include "ðŸš€ Launch Picco", "ðŸ“Š Leaderboard", and "ðŸŽ¯ Predictions" buttons
4. WHEN buttons are clicked THEN they SHALL launch the appropriate Mini App pages

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for the `/start` command, so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/start` command fails THEN the error SHALL be logged with detailed information
2. WHEN the bot cannot send a message THEN it SHALL retry once before logging the failure
3. WHEN the bot starts up THEN it SHALL log confirmation that command handlers are registered
4. WHEN a `/start` command is received THEN it SHALL be logged for monitoring purposes

### Requirement 5: BotFather Integration Compatibility

**User Story:** As a bot administrator, I want the bot to work correctly with BotFather welcome messages, so that I can use Telegram's built-in features without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a BotFather welcome message is configured THEN the `/start` command SHALL still trigger the bot's custom handler
2. WHEN users see the BotFather welcome message THEN they SHALL still be able to use `/start` to get the interactive buttons
3. WHEN the bot description or welcome message is updated in BotFather THEN it SHALL NOT affect the `/start` command functionality
4. WHEN the bot is restarted THEN all command handlers SHALL be properly registered regardless of BotFather configuration
